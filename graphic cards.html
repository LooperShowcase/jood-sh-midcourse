          No. The RTX 3090 is not worth it. It is simply the most powerful GPU
          on the market right now. ... As per Nvidia, it's the Big Ferocious GPU
          with Titan-class (high VRAM) performance.

          Verdict. The Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti is a powerful flagship GPU that offers
          excellent 4K ray tracing performance, but the £400 price hike makes it
          tough to recommend it over the also very impressive RTX 3080. While
          both GPUs made the cut for our best graphics card list, the 3080
          offers better value for your money.

        The 4K and 1440p gaming performance are what make the Nvidia RTX 3070 an
        attractive buy. If you want ray tracing too, go with the RTX 3080 or
        better. ... The gaming performance of the RTX 3070 is worth a small
        premium though when compared to the previous generation of Nvidia
        graphics cards
